INSTALL
composer require nwidart/laravel-modules

php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Nwidart\Modules\LaravelModulesServiceProvider"

By default, the module classes are not loaded automatically. You can autoload your modules by adding merge-plugin to the extra section:

"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "dont-discover": []
    },
    "merge-plugin": {
        "include": [
            "Modules/*/composer.json"
        ]
    }
},

Tip: don't forget to run composer dump-autoload afterwards.

Demo

To enable a module edit
module_statuses.json or run the
command:

Generator Path
By default, these are the files that are
generated by default where generate is
set to true, when false is used that path
is not generated.
Don't like Entities for the Models here's
where you can change the path to
Models instead.

Scan Path
By default, modules are loaded from a
directory called Modules, in addition in
the scan path inside paths vendor is also
used. Any packages installed for
modules can be loaded from here.
'scan' => [
'enabled' => false,
'paths' => [
base_path('vendor/*/*'),
],
],
You can add your own locations for
instance say you're building a large
application and want to have multiple
module folder locations, you can create
as many as needed.
'scan' => [
'enabled' => true,
'paths' => [
base_path('ModulesCms'),
base_path('ModulesERP'),
Introduce
base_path('ModulesShop'),
],
],
Remember to set enabled too true
to enable these locations.
